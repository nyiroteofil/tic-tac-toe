# tic-tac-toe
Phew... now this project was a though nut to crack.
On the first day I paniced a lot because I didn't understood the iife
stuff, but when I finaly understood it evrything went according to plan.
This was a very good project to cement the objects and iifes into my knowlendge.
Saddly I couldn't make an AI for it because I would have had to rewrite a lot of my
code and my summer break is almost over and my last year at high-school starts.
I rather go further in the curriculum.
